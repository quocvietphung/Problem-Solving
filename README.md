# Problem-Solving

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to algorithm problems from HackerRank, implemented in the Python programming language.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to help developers learn and practice problem-solving skills by working through HackerRank problems. It also serves to improve Python programming skills and understanding of common algorithms and data structures.

## Set up conda environment
- Create conda environment
    ```sh
    conda create -n Problem-Solving python=3.8
    ```
- Activate environment Problem-Solving
    ```sh
    conda activate Problem-Solving 
    ```
- Upgrade requirements.txt
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
    ```
- Install requirements.txt
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- If you want do deactivate conda, type this command
    ```sh
    conda deactivate
    ```

## Directory Structure

- The name of each subdirectory represents a problem on HackerRank.
- Inside each subdirectory, you will find a `solution.py` file containing the Python solution for that problem.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the problem of your choice, identified by classname of problem in folder HackerRank.
